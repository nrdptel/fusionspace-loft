# Backlog

Rough edges, missing affordances, and ideas too big for one pass — noticed while working,
not yet done. Newest first. One line each. Anything here is fair game for the next session.

- The diagram's seven drag handles are 24x24 px on a phone — the one control the whole
  direct-manipulation story rests on, and the only thing in the Design workspace still under the
  project's own 44 px minimum. A transparent 44 px hit circle is the obvious fix, but on a 346x89 px
  phone diagram seven of them would overlap, so it needs a touch-only layout (fewer handles, or
  spread ones) rather than a bigger circle. Measured on a Pixel 7 viewport.
- The to-scale diagram is 346x89 px on a phone — 89 px of height for a whole airframe. It zooms, but
  the default fit is unreadable, and the Design workspace runs 1,892 px deep before you reach the
  fields.
- Wind barely moves Loft's apogee, because weathercocking is rotation and the solver is 3-DOF. On
  `USLI2025-FULLSCALE`'s own five stored runs at 0/5/10/15/20 mph, OpenRocket's apogee falls
  1,602 → 1,549 m (−3.3%) while Loft reads 1,634 m at every wind speed. Now stated in the
  limitations log; closing it properly means integrating pitch, i.e. the 6-DOF project.
- The Wood Handbook (USDA FPL-GTR-190, Table 5-1) unblocks half of the fin-flutter shear-modulus
  problem below: it gives citable G_LR/E_L ratios — balsa 0.054, basswood 0.056, yellow birch 0.074
  — so G follows from a species' E_L. What is still missing is a citable E_L for hobby-grade stock
  (balsa's varies ~3× across the density range the shops sell), and any source at all for birch
  *plywood* panel shear and cardboard. That spread is the real finding: G is uncertain by ~2× on
  exactly the soft stocks that trip the warning, and Vf goes as √G, so the honest fix is probably a
  flutter-speed *band* per material rather than a better single number.
- The parts table and the Mass & balance panel are two tables of the same components on the same
  tab — the parts table now carries mass beside each part's dimensions, and Mass & balance carries
  % dry, per-part CG, the dry total and the CSV. Worth unifying into one component table (which is
  what OpenRocket's tree is) rather than leaving the overlap.
- Diagram handles and number fields still disagree on range: the fin-span handle clamps to the
  framed extent (5–84 mm on the 38 mm sample) and reports that as its `aria-valuemax`, while the
  fin-span field accepts 120 mm and computes a perfectly good 4.79 cal. The handle's bound is a
  framing constraint dressed as a property limit.
- RASAero `<Protuberance>` is still unread, but the corpus says it barely matters: the only one
  present (`Complex.Two-Stage`) is 0.25 in² of frontal area against a 4-inch airframe's 12.6 in²,
  so modelling it cannot move that file's +12.4% residual. Lower priority than the entry it
  replaces suggested.
- Design number fields show the design's own value only as a grey placeholder, so a set value and an
  inherited one look nearly alike and any tweak means retyping the whole number.
- There is no undo, and "Reset to as-designed" is all-or-nothing with no per-field revert; "Import
  another" discards every what-if without asking.
- The motor sweep and the parameter sweep show a labelled spinner but no count. Monte-Carlo does it
  well ("32/300 flown") and the RocketPy cross-check does it best (runtime → install → fly); neither
  sweep's worker reports progress, so adding one means threading a callback through.
- Analyze results survive an edit now, but not a reload: the session keeps the design, units, edits
  and motor configuration, and a 300-flight Monte-Carlo is still gone.
- The parameter sweep offers 7 axes against ~23 editable dimensions — no fin count, materials,
  surface finish, chute sizes, payload mass or boattail.
- The fin-flutter check cries wolf: across the corpus it raises the hard "fins may flutter" warning
  on 31 of 94 flights — a third — including OpenRocket's own bundled Estes-class examples, which fly
  every weekend. The formula is not the problem (it reproduces Apogee #291's worked example: 260.7
  vs ~262 m/s). Every false alarm is on a soft, density-variable stock — cardboard (G assumed
  0.02 GPa), balsa (0.09), basswood (0.17), birch ply (0.62) — and Vf goes as the SQUARE ROOT of G,
  so the shear modulus is the most leveraged input in the estimate and `lib/sim/flutter.ts` carries
  it as an uncited table of "representative engineering figures". Re-tabling it needs a citable
  source (the Apogee newsletter's own table would be ideal — that PDF is scanned, so it isn't
  extractable); substituting one guess for another isn't worth doing. Until then the warning is
  training flyers to ignore a safety flag. One extreme case is NOT Loft's fault: Cherokee-E-5055's
  0.01x margin comes from the file's own 0.254 mm (0.01 in) balsa fin.
- The Analyze workspace's empty state is four full-width cards of prose with one button each, which
  reads as a menu; once run, the panels themselves are dense and good. Worth compressing the idle
  state so all four fit above the fold and the width isn't spent on a single column.
- A design library: the shelf under "Your designs" now keeps the last eight designs opened and
  reopens any of them, which covers working across a build. What it isn't yet is a library — no
  switching without going back to the import screen, no renaming or grouping there, and each entry
  carries the design but not the what-ifs that were set on it.
- The phone's design what-if panel is still a two-column grid of ~24 small fields, and the diagram
  defaults to fit-width (now zoomable, but fit on a 29:1 airframe is 11 px of body). The natural
  next step is per-component editing driven by the diagram selection.
- The design what-if panel is a wall of ~24 number fields. Only the fins, body wall, nose and
  boattail have diagram handles; recovery, payload, materials and finish are typing-only.
- The parts list selects both ways and now carries each part's mass and sorts by any column, but it
  is still read-only. What OpenRocket's component tree has and Loft's doesn't is add and delete, and
  a selected part opening its own fields — that is the gap that keeps the editor feeling like a
  viewer with fields beside it. It needs the edits model to grow past one flat bag of ~26 global
  fields ("the" fin set, "the" nose) to something addressed per component id.
- The corpus fetch is wired — `fixtures.lock.json`, `scripts/fetch-fixtures.mjs`, an npm script and a
  CI step — but CI still fetches nothing until a `FIXTURES_TOKEN` repository secret exists. That is
  the one owner-side action left; until then the suite gates only a machine that already has the
  files. The network path itself is the one branch never exercised here (no real token in the
  sandbox); the local-tarball, tampered-file, moved-snapshot and no-token paths all are.
- A no-recovery descent is a tumble, not a dart. On `FullScaleModelTH.rkt`'s plugged configuration
  Loft comes in at 152 m/s against RockSim's 83 m/s: both agree nothing opened, but RockSim models
  the unstable body's drag and Loft flies it nose-down. Worth a tumbling-drag model for the
  ballistic case, where the number feeds a safety warning.
- A RockSim `<CustomFinSet>`'s fin tabs (`TabLength`/`TabDepth`/`TabOffset`) and cant angle are
  read past — the tab is structure inside the airframe, so it is mass Loft doesn't count, and a
  canted custom fin flies uncanted. Both are zero on the corpus's only custom-fin design.
- The service worker precaches route HTML but not the RSC segment payloads Next's router fetches
  for a client-side navigation (`__next.*.txt?_rsc=…`, ~580 kB, and the `_rsc` hash means they
  can't be matched without `ignoreSearch`). Offline, an in-app link still lands on the right page
  because the router falls back to a full navigation — but that reload drops in-memory state.
- `demo-rocksim.rkt`'s stored `<SimulationResults>` are author estimates too, but RockSim's format
  has no `external` marker to carry that, so the panel still labels them RockSim's. Worth either a
  document-level flag on the import or dropping the stored block from that fixture.
- Loft still reads +31% apogee / +43% velocity against `demo-dual-deploy`'s stated figures, and
  those figures are internally inconsistent (2,250 m apogee at the same 20.2 s time-to-apogee Loft
  reaches 2,940 m in). The label is now honest, but the demo would land better with figures that
  hold together — regenerate them from the engine, or state a range.
- Remaining corpus residuals, each excused in the suite's KNOWN_ISSUES with a reason: APEX K-Dart
  -22.8% and OR-vs-RAS -42%/-66% (both supersonic, outside the validated envelope and the biggest
  argument for a real wave-drag model); `03.Three-stage` max velocity -17% after the ignition fix;
  Punisher sim 10 -10.4%; USLI zero-delay +11.7%.
- The corpus sweep and the per-step drag cross-check are worth committing as real dev tools with
  assertions rather than being rewritten as throwaway probes each session — the sweep now is, the
  drag cross-check isn't.
- RASAero import still leaves `<Protuberance>` parts unread, and a SECOND booster stage is skipped
  (only Booster 1 flies). RASAero's `<MachAlt>` Mach-vs-altitude table is also unread — it is a
  second per-step oracle, in a file that already gives one cross-check.
- A RASAero import's mass is a single point, so the airframe carries no moment of inertia of its
  own. Harmless for the 3-DOF solve; a real gap the day rotational dynamics arrive.
- Two RockSim corpus fixtures store results that don't match their own geometry (`TubeFins1.rkt`
  weighs its tube fins as solid rods; `rocksimTestRocket1.rkt` reads 52% low on max acceleration,
  a pre-deployment number) — both are OpenRocket's synthetic import-test files, and both are now
  excused in the sweep as unusable oracles. They still cost coverage: nothing else in the corpus
  exercises tube fins against stored results, so that geometry has no accuracy check at all.
- ThrustCurve has no RASP file for Cesaroni H225-14A (RockSim `.rse` only); an `.rse` curve reader
  would unlock it and a long tail of other motors that only ship in that format.
- RocketPy `.py` / `.ipynb` design scripts don't import; the corpus carries three, two of
  them with *actual flown* apogees (NDRT 2020, Valetudo) — the strongest ground truth there is.
- Tube fins can't be edited: no diagram handles, no what-if fields, and `lib/model/edit.ts`
  still finds only trapezoid/elliptical/freeform sets as "the" fin set.
- Tube-fin aero omits tube-to-body and tube-to-tube interference drag, any ring-wing lift
  beyond the captured streamtube, and the shielding of the airframe inside the tubes; the
  CP reads ~0.9 caliber forward of OpenRocket's on its own example.
- Ring tails (`<RingTail>` in RockSim) are still dropped with a warning.
- `Pods--airframes and winglets.ork` sim 1 reads +25%: pods are dropped, so the comparison is
  withheld, but the pods' own drag is simply missing.
- Deployment velocity reads worst in percentage terms but is ill-conditioned near apogee, not badly
  modelled — the census on /docs/validation shows the absolute error barely moves across bands. The
  genuinely wrong cases (e.g. +153% on OpenRocket's tube-fin example) are the ones left to explain.
- A design with SEVERAL unresolvable motors makes you accept the same-casing substitute one by one.
  (A partly-resolved configuration now withholds its stored comparison, so at least the missing
  curve no longer reads as an accuracy gap.)
